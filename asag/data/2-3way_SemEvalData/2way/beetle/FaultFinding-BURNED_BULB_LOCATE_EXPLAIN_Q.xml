    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer249" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj10-l1.qa249" accuracy="incorrect">it allows you to measure electrical states between terminals</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer250" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj11-l1.qa236" accuracy="correct">because the voltage measures the difference in electrical states of two terminals, so it can determine where there is a gap, or wehre there is a connection.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer250" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj11-l1.qa237" accuracy="correct">voltage is the difference in electrical states between two terminals, so a gap or a connection in a circuit can be determined by the voltage.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer250" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj11-l1.qa238" accuracy="incorrect">the electrical state between two terminals is the voltage. a gap shows voltage, while a connection results in no voltage.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer256" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbj11-l1.qa239" accuracy="correct">a bulb connects the terminals, so there will be a difference in electrical state if there is a fault.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer248" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb1-l1.qa187" accuracy="incorrect">The electrical states of two terminals when connected will determine the gaps and help to locate a burned out bulb.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer251" id="FaultFinding.BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb2-l1.qa191" accuracy="incorrect">It will help find where the gap in the circuit is.</studentAnswer>
