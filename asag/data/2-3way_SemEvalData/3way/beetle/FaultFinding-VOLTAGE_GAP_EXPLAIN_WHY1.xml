    <studentAnswer count="1" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbj10-l1.qa176" accuracy="contradictory">terminal 1 was connected to the positive terminal of the battery</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbj10-l1.qa177" accuracy="contradictory">because it was connected to the positive terminal</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbj10-l1.qa178" accuracy="contradictory">because there was no gap from the positive terminal of the battery</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbj11-l1.qa183" accuracy="incorrect">because 1.5 v minus 0 v equals 1.5 v</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer154" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbj11-l1.qa184" accuracy="incorrect">the voltage is the difference between the electrical state of the terminals.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer156" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbj11-l1.qa185" accuracy="contradictory">terminal 1 is connected to the negative terminal of the battery and has 0 v, and the positive terminal of the battery has 1.5 v.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" id="FaultFinding.VOLTAGE_GAP_EXPLAIN_WHY1.sbjb2-l1.qa146" accuracy="contradictory">The posititve terminal is not damaged.</studentAnswer>
