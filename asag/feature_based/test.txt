help you locate a burned out bulb try to answer in terms of electrical states connections and or a gap. measuring voltage indicates the place where the electrical state changes due to a damaged bulb. measuring voltage indicates the place where the electrical state changes due to a gap. measuring voltage indicates whether two terminals are connected to each other. measuring voltage indicates whether two terminals are separated by a gap. a zero voltage means that the terminals are connected. a nonzero voltage means that the terminals are not connected. a zero voltage means that the

why. a battery uses a chemical reaction to maintain different electrical states at the terminals. explain your reasoning. bulbs b and c are still in closed paths with the battery. if bulb a burns out bulbs b and c are still in a closed path. each bulb is in its own path. explain your reasoning. bulbs a and c are still in closed paths with the battery. bulbs a and c are in a closed path. each bulb is in its own path. bulb b is in a separate path. explain your reasoning. bulbs a and b are still in closed paths with the battery. bulbs a and b are in a closed path. each bulb is in its own path. bulb c is in a separate path. why didnt bulbs a and c go out after bulb b burned out. bulbs a and c are still contained in closed paths with the battery. bulbs a and c are still in closed paths. b is not in their paths. a b and c are in different paths. explain your reasoning. a and c are in different paths with the battery. a and c are not in the same path with the battery. a and c are in different paths. a and c are not in the same path. explain your reasoning. b and c are in the same path with the battery. b and c are in the same path. explain your reasoning. a and c are in different paths with the battery. a and c are not in the same path with the battery. a and c are in different paths. a and c are not in the same path. explain your reasoning. if bulb a burns out b and c are no longer in a closed path with the battery. if bulb a burns out there is no longer a closed path containing b c and the battery. if bulb a burns out neither b nor c is in a closed path. explain your reasoning. if c burns out then a and b are still in a closed path with the battery. if c burns out then a and b are still in a closed path. why do both bulbs a and b stay on when bulb c is burned out. if c burns out then a and b are still in a closed path with the battery. there is a closed path with a and b that c is not in. if c is damaged a and b are still in a closed path. a and b have their own path. there is still a closed path. under what circumstances will a damaged burned out bulb affect another bulb. if they are in the same path the burned out bulb affects the other bulb. it depends on whether or not they are in the same path. the damaged bulb and the other bulb must be contained in the same path. why not. there is still a closed path containing switch z switch x bulbs a and c and the battery. there is a path containing a c z and the battery. there is a path containing a c z and x. there is a path containing a. bulb a is still in a closed path with the battery. describe the paths in this diagram and explain how those paths account for the results. bulb a is in a path which does not contain b and c so bulbs b and c dont affect it bulbs b and c are in the same path they affect each other but bulb a doesnt affect them. bulb a is in a path which does not contain b and c and isnt affected by b or c b and c are in the same path and affect each other. there is a path containing a and a different path containing b and c. why was bulb a on when switch y was open and switch z was closed. bulb a is still contained in a closed path with the battery. bulb a is still contained in a closed path with the battery and switch z. there is no path containing both switch y and bulb a. switch y and bulb a are not in the same closed path. why was bulb c off when switch z was open. bulb c was no longer in a closed path with the battery. there was no longer a closed path containing bulb c and the battery. there is a path containing z and c the open switch z creates a gap. there is a path containing z and c opening of switch z causes the path to be open. there is a path containing both z and c. a gap. bulb c was not in a closed path. bulb c was in no closed path. there are no closed paths. what role does the path play in determining whether or not a switch affects a bulb. if a bulb and a switch are in the same path the switch affects the bulb. the switch and the bulb have to be in the same path. when switch x was closed and switch y was open why was bulb a on. bulb a was still contained in the same closed path with the battery. bulb a is still contained in a closed path with the battery and switch x. there is no path containing both switch y and bulb a. switch y and bulb a are not in the same closed path. when switch x was open and switch y was closed why were bulbs b and c on. bulb b and bulb c were still contained in the same closed path with the battery. no path containing both the switch x and either bulb b or bulb c. there is a path with b and c that does not include x. under what circumstances will a switch affect a bulb. when the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path. what are the conditions that are required to make a bulb light up. there is a closed path containing both the bulb and a battery. the bulb and the battery are in a closed path. the circuit has a closed path. there is a complete circuit. one terminal of the bulb has to be connected to one terminal of the battery and the other terminal of the bulb has to be connected to the different terminal of the battery. explain your reasoning. bulb b creates a gap. a gap. there is a gap in a circuit. there is an open path. there is an incomplete circuit. there is no closed path. why does a damaged bulb impact a circuit. a damaged bulb creates a gap. there is a gap in the circuit. there is an open path. there is no closed path. there is an incomplete circuit. explain your reasoning. a and c are in the same closed path. a and c are in the same path. explain why circuit 2 is not a short circuit. the battery in 2 is not in a closed path. there is no closed path containing the battery. the battery is in an open path. explain why circuit 4 is not a short circuit. circuit 4 has no closed paths. the battery in 4 is not in a closed path. there is no closed path. the battery is in an open path. explain why circuit 5 is a short circuit. the battery is contained in a path in which there is no bulb. the battery is contained in a path which does not contain any other components. the bulb is not in the closed path containing the battery. the battery is contained in a closed path in which there is no bulb. the battery is contained in a closed path which does not contain any other components. what do you think the red x means. the battery is damaged. there is a short circuit. why does an open switch impact a circuit. the open switch creates a gap. a gap. there is a gap in a circuit. the path is not closed. there is an incomplete circuit. there is an open path.
