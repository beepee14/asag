  <questionText>Why was bulb C off when switch Z was open?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer category="BEST" id="answer299" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS1">Bulb C was no longer in a closed path with the battery</referenceAnswer>
    <referenceAnswer category="BEST" id="answer300" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS1A">There was no longer a closed path containing Bulb C and the battery</referenceAnswer>
    <referenceAnswer category="GOOD" id="answer301" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS1_OLD">there is a path containing Z and C. The open switch Z creates a gap</referenceAnswer>
    <referenceAnswer category="GOOD" id="answer302" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS2">there is a path containing Z and C. Opening of switch Z causes the path to be open</referenceAnswer>
    <referenceAnswer category="GOOD" id="answer303" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS3">there is a path containing both Z and C</referenceAnswer>
    <referenceAnswer category="KEYWORD" id="answer304" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS4">a gap</referenceAnswer>
    <referenceAnswer category="MINIMAL" id="answer305" fileID="PARALLEL_SWITCH_EXPLAIN_Q2_ANS5A">Bulb C was not in a closed path</referenceAnswer>
